# music-network
final project

I am setting out to build a social network primarily for muscisians for my final Iron Yard project.
First I will build a basic django crud app and rest api for the MVP.  I plan to have this done by wed
and add permissions thursday and friday.  The next step will be to build a simple front end application 
with css and javascript that communicates with my django backend.  If I have time I plan on building 
an android front end that also talks to my django backend.
